            <h1 align=center> My story: </h1>
            <p style="padding: 25px; font-size: 18px;"> My name is Jeyte Hagaley. In the late 1990’s my parents came to the United States to escape the Civil War that caused the death of many Somali citizens and displayed millions. As American born citizen, even though I was not there to see any of this, I could see and feel their pain and grief through the stories that they told me as if I was there.  Despite everything that they went thought, education was always important. Being their first child came with many difficult tasks which included being an interpreter for my mom, assimilating to the American and Somali culture while keeping my personal identity, and knowing I am the outlook of my parent’s hard work and the pressure of knowing that my four little brothers will one day look up to me.</p>

            <div class="row">
            
            <p style="padding: 25px; font-size: 18px;">Despite all of the challenges that I have faced, I have had much success. I have been able to complete my Associates degree through the Running start program at Seattle Central College, while still in high school, in addition to being the first person in my family to go on to a 4-year school. I am very happy with how far I have come, I grew up in a place where I faced both political and economic challenges. But thanks to a lot of hard work a support from my family and friends, I was able to overcome those challenges and push harder for a brighter future.  </p>
